  The first time they met, the girl was wearing a white dress. It was the kind of dress you could wear to a wedding, and never to a funeral. She had been wearing it for both. The boy was in black, his lips painted red like her lipstick, and the two of them made quite a pair: one dressed in mourning for the end of life, and the other dressed in mourning for the death of love.  They danced together that night, and they danced together every night after that. He would lead her around the dance floor with his hand on her waist, and she would follow him with her eyes closed. Sometimes they’d stop dancing just to hold each other close; sometimes they’d stop dancing just to kiss, their lips locked together until their faces were redder than their lips were painted. They would dance until dawn broke over the horizon, until they couldn’t see each other anymore because of all the light streaming into their eyes.  But one day she didn’t come back for him. She didn’t come back for anyone that day; she was too busy dying in hospital from a heart attack she had suffered during one of their dances earlier that evening. All he could do now was wait until he died too; he couldn't live without her anymore.

Her name was Linh, but she was often called The Dragon. She would lie on her back, sword drawn on the floor beside her, and as I passed by she would swing her sword at me. My calf muscles would tense as though they could feel the wind from her sword-stroke. She’d often shout at me and say that I needed to be more proactive about seeking out my opponent. “What do you think I’m doing?” I’d reply, before passing her. “I am your opponent!” she’d tell me and laugh, before swinging the sword again. At first, when she spoke to me as if we were enemies in battle, it came across as a little coldly mechanical: maybe even a little intimidatingly so. But soon I got used to it and started to look forward to her attention at every opportunity. To know that someone else was taking an interest in my progress gave me wings and a sense of purpose that had been previously lacking in my life – a sense of purpose inspired by the greatest dragon slayer of all time…

  The girl was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Her parents were wealthy, and they had a country mansion with a large garden. The kind of garden where you can do anything you like, including building your own tree house. One day, when she was playing on the ground floor, she found her way to the attic and discovered a dusty old trunk that her parents had forgotten about. It was full of old toys and books. She took out a small wooden doll’s house and placed it on top of her head, pretending it was a hat. She took out a frayed book with no cover and started reading aloud from it: "Once upon a time there lived...” She couldn’t read very well, but she loved hearing the sound of words coming from her mouth. But then she heard footsteps approaching, so she quickly put everything back in the trunk as best as she could and closed it. The footsteps were getting closer. Then the door opened and there stood her mother. “What are you doing?” Her mother asked sternly “Nothing,” said the girl “I just saw this trunk here and I wanted to see what’s inside." “Did you find anything interesting?” Her mother asked “No," said the girl "There is nothing interesting in here." Her mother nodded slowly "Then maybe you should go outside for some fresh air." And so they went outside together to play in the garden.

We were in love with the idea of each other. She was a novelist, and I was a poet, and it at first seemed like we would be the perfect couple. We were both fans of the same obscure bands, we both loved art, we both loved to talk about how much we loved to talk about the things we loved. But when it came down to the real thing, our relationship was based on words: how they felt on the page; how they felt in our mouths; how they felt when they left us. And then there was that summer when she went to Europe for three months. I thought I could handle it but I couldn’t. Without her around, my words turned into silence. My poetry became empty words on a page and my novels became nothing more than empty pages. I missed her so much that my heart turned into a block of ice and my words froze inside me until there was nothing left but silence.

  Every day for the past three years, the man has brought his lover to this very spot. He has brought her here, to the top of the hill, where they can look over the city and pay homage to the mountain that looms behind them. He tells her how he met God in a dream, how he created her in His image, how He told him that love was worth clinging to. Down below their home is a city of people who have been touched by God’s grace: an old man who can balance a cup on his nose; a teenage girl who can bend metal with her bare hands; a baby boy whose tears are so hot they burn holes in his mother’s breast. The man has told his lover about each and every one of them, about each and every miracle. She listens without comment: it is not love that compels him but duty. She knew this well enough, but also wasn't willing to let him go because no matter how much they tried to hide it, their love was indeed a duty.

‘I’m sorry,’ I say, and he doesn’t reply. I look away from him, out of the window, at the passing scenery. It is a dull grey day. We are travelling to the coast. I really don’t like the coast because the sea is too big and too blue and too cold for me. But he likes it there, he always says it reminds him of home. I look back at him; his eyes are closed now and his face is looking very peaceful. He does looks like a child when he sleeps; innocent and vulnerable. His hands looks small in his lap, with long fingers that are always cold to touch. I had thought his hands were beautiful before; they were so delicate and elegant when he played piano for me on that first night we met in a bar in town. Now they look frail to me, as if they could snap in two at any moment if I were to squeeze them tightly enough or if he got angry with me or if he was to be ill again...
===
The old couple lay under the covers, their faces pressed together like a book. They were so close they could feel each others breath on their lips. The woman smiled, and her husband smiled back. It almost looked like they were kissing, but they weren’t; instead, they were breathing each other in. The oxygen flowing into their lungs and mingling with the carbon dioxide from their exhalations. She closed her eyes. She could hear him humming softly in her ear, a song she had been humming to him every night since they had first met, forty years ago. He was singing it now because he couldn’t sleep without hearing it from her lips one last time before he went out for the night. “I’ll be home again tomorrow night…” His voice grew softer as she drifted off to sleep. She knew that he would be there again when she woke up; she knew that he would still be breathing in her breath and looking at her with his big blue eyes as if to say “I love you so much." she knew that he would still be there when she died ten years later, of heart failure while sleeping next to him; but for now – just this little moment – she knew that the man was all hers and that no one in all of the world would ever have him but her.

  I had been chasing my love around the world for three years. She was at a literary festival in London, I was in Prague, and we were sending each other emails daily, quipping about the city, telling each other how much we missed each other. The next day she would be in Paris, and I would be in Beijing. We never planned to meet up. To see her face-to-face was too painful for me, too much of an acknowledgement that we were not together. And then one night, she emailed me saying that she was coming to Beijing and wanted to see me. With shaking hands, I booked a room at the hotel where she was staying. When she arrived the next day, I didn’t recognise her because her face had changed so much since the last time we saw each other: it had aged by twenty years. But it didn’t matter; all that mattered is that she was here with me now and nothing else mattered anymore.  
===
  The woman is a stranger to herself, she’s sure of it. She has no idea who she is, where she’s from, or what her name is. She knows that there are two men in her life, and that they both love her. One of them is called David. He works at a bank and smiles all the time when he sees her. The other one is called Tom. He has a beard and doesn't smile as much as David does when he sees her, but she loves him more because of it, and she thinks that Tom might be the one who loves her more than David does.  One day, the woman comes home to find that David and Tom are fighting over her in the kitchen. She’s scared by this, because they’ve never fought over anything before, and they have never fought over her before either. They are shouting at each other in a language that she doesn’t understand, but they both seem very angry about something. Then there is a horrible sound like breaking glass, and then everything goes very silent, so silent that the woman could hear herself breathing for the first time in years. And then Tom screams out loud like someone had sliced him open with a knife, or broken a bottle on his face. This l my made the woman scream too, amd David in turn screamed.

She was a widow, and he was dead. Once, they had been a married couple, but now that was a distant memory. Now, she lived in the cemetery where he had been buried. It made perfect sense to her that she would live there, among the dead. When they were married, he had always been so affectionate. At night he would hold her in his arms and whisper words of his love for her. She would lie there watching him sleep until it became too painful to watch him not breathe anymore. But she held onto him as long as she could. Then, one night when they were asleep together, a fire broke out in their house. He never woke up; it was as if he knew what was happening before it happened. She was able to escape with her life. Now when she went to visit his grave, she never stayed for very long because it hurt too much to see his name carved in the stone beside the dates of his birth and death. The rest of the inscription said “Beloved Husband,” but all that really mattered to her were those dates: 1955-1977.

He desires her like he desires books to read, as if the two are inseparable entities. But when they're together there are no words between them, only heavy, rapid breath and the closeness of their bodies. She will kiss his scars as if they were her own, all the while tracing a path from one to another with her fingers. Seasons pass and somehow he never manages to leave there, this small town with its small house up on a hill overlooking the sea, but everything is okay. When he watches her sleep at night he thinks of the young boy she used to be; she still has that cute mole under her ear but now it's surrounded by peach fuzz. He longs for another short adventure, with her and soon she will want him too, like he already wants her back. It's like looking into a window at night to see the future illuminated by love's bright glow; it will happen inevitably and suddenly in an instant without warning or preparation and will end just as abruptly with hope evaporated into thin air.
===
The young couple began their flirting with a heated debate about the existence of the soul. The girl had an almost religious belief in it and was on a personal quest to prove its existence. While he argued that the soul was an invention of religions to keep people under control. It annoyed her when he refused to believe in any higher power other than himself, though she enjoyed dining with him even when they argued, and so sought ways to change his mind. When she talked about the soul, he’d reach into his pocket, pull out a small piece of quartz and tell her that it had been given to him by his grandmother who’d told him that if he ever found someone who could hear the music within it then he would know that he had met his soul mate. Grinning at her with those bewitching green eyes, he would hold each end of the tiny bead between his fingers and ask if she could hear anything and she would open her mouth and say ‘yes’ as if making love.
===
  It was an unromantic way to meet. He had been beside himself with worry ever since he saw her sitting so forlornly on the bench. Her companion was taking some time and he didn’t know what to do, so he sat down next to her. They didn’t speak for a long time, both too shy to say anything. But they sighed in unison and their hands clasped at the same moment, like they were unwilling to let go of each other. Looking at his profile, she knew that he looked a little sadder than most people she knew. His dark eyes were melancholy and set in a face that seemed carved by time into lines of inconsolable grief. But suddenly her heart surged with a strength she had never known before and she wanted to be his joy again, everyone’s joy, with their laughter echoing off the walls of nearby buildings, bouncing off the gutters and into the sky. No one should be sad when they could laugh like this! ‘I am sorry for your loss,' she said finally as she squeezed his cold hand gently with hers.  
===
The woman was born with a birthmark that looks like the continent of Australia, and so she had to travel far and wide, from the deserts of the outback to the beaches of Bondi. She had many lovers in her time, but none so special as the one who came from there. He was a water spirit, a kind of mermaid who would come out at night to dance under moonlight. He would dance for hours, his tail undulating in time with his movements. When he saw her for the first time, he thought she was quite beautiful. She was sitting on a rock at the edge of the sea with her legs crossed over one another, a book balanced on her knees. He came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist as he whispered in her ear. “I’ve been watching you for some time now; I can’t help but admire your grace.” The woman blushed and turned around to face him. “And what about you?” she said coyly. “Do you have any admirers?” “I do indeed,” he replied as he took her hand in his own and kissed it gently before swimming off into the ocean once more.
===
  The man and the woman were both born in the same year, and they both died in the same year. Just like some would say it's fate or destiny, they met in the afterlife, and they fell in love. They spent their days walking through a meadow of lavender, talking about their lives, and making love under a tree of blackthorn. At night, they slept under the stars. One night, as they lay together under the stars, she told him she was pregnant with his child. He was overjoyed at this news, but he was also afraid: what if he died before his child was born? What if he died before his child had grown up? What if he died before his child had found their own love? He told her these things one night as they lay together under the stars. She said nothing for a long time, and then she told him that she would always be with him no matter what happened to either of them. And so it was that when he died on May 5th of that year, she followed him into death on May 6th.  
===
She was a girl born under the Northern Lights, and so, when he saw her for the first time, her skin glowed with the light of a thousand stars. And as she grew from girl to woman, her skin only shone brighter. It was some years before he worked up the courage to ask if he could touch that light, and she allowed him a brief caress before abruptly turning to walk back home. He followed her there in the dark, where they sat by the fire and talked for hours on end about their dreams. She told him how she wanted to be an artist, but that she didn't have any talent. He told her how he wanted to be a musician, but that his band had broken up. Before they knew it, they were talking about their past relationships and their current situations: how one had been a housewife and mother until she was twenty-nine; how one had been in love with someone who didn't love him back; how one had been single for more than half of his life; how one had believed in marriage before realizing it wasn't what he wanted at all. They talked about everything but themselves until there was little left to say.
===
  I loved him the moment I saw him. I had left my heart at home, but he had a box of matches. He offered me a light. As our skin touched, his match went out and he smiled that let me know he understood what it was like to be restless, like me. We were married six weeks later in a small ceremony on the beach as the sunset over the horizon, a vision so magnificent that for one second my heart forgot to feel empty.  Throughout my childhood, my mother warned me about men like him. She is very religious and believes that all things can either be used or cast away. My mother is like a sea sponge, absorbing everything from her surroundings like water fills every crevice in its porous texture until there is no more room to add another drop of water and no more room for air. And it becomes saturated with its own self-loathing until it cannot bear the weight of its own existence any longer. And it sinks to the ocean floor and dies in agonizing surrender. What had she absorbed about men that she could so easily predict our fate? Life is not an inevitable march forward, but sometimes joins us with our destined partner before we even know they exist - can we truly expect anything else? The man upstairs plays out his symphony for us; we are merely instruments in his odd orchestra.

  The man in the dark room was not a man at all, but a woman. She had been born with a condition that caused her body to grow hair on her face and chest, and so she wore the clothes of a man. She was in love with a woman who was in love with another man. She and this woman are friends. They met regularly at the bar near the train station. They talked about their men, how they were both so handsome, how they were both so good to them. One day they went for a walk in the park together, as they often did. They talked about their men again, how much they loved them both equally, how they could never choose between them. And then one of them said, “I wish you weren’t wearing that mask” and took it off her friend’s face to reveal her true identity: she was not a man at all but a woman like herself.  
===
  ‘I’m sorry,’ the boy said. ‘I can’t. I just can’t.’ ‘It’s okay, it doesn’t matter, it was a stupid idea anyway. I don’t know why I thought you could help me. You were right, you should never have come here. It was a stupid idea. What am I going to do now? Oh god, what am I going to do?’ The girl was sobbing and the boy held her close and rocked her gently back and forth until she had calmed down enough to speak again. ‘What are you going to do? You're going to be okay, we'll figure something out together, no problem.' The girl looked up at him through tear-filled eyes and smiled weakly before burying her face in his chest once more. She felt safe there in his arms; she felt like nothing bad could ever happen as long as he held her like that and told her everything would be okay.  
===
  The boy looked at the girl and she stared into his eyes. They were both looking for something, but neither knew what. They tried to talk about it, but they never got far before giving up. He tried to tell her that he didn’t know what he was looking for, that if she wanted to leave him, she should just go and not worry about him. He thought that if she left him then at least he could stop looking for something that wasn’t even there. The girl said nothing in response, because she was too busy thinking about how she didn’t know what love was supposed to feel like and whether it would be possible for her to learn how to love someone when she couldn’t even figure out how to love herself. So they carried on living together, day after day, month after month, year after year, without ever saying a word about what they were both looking for.

Her mother then left the room. Little did she know that her daughter was reading her mum's old diary, discovering how in love she fell with her father. How she kissed each other. How she hugged each other. How much she would like that but, sadly enough, couldn't find. She would never understand what the problem was with her, until she met Paul.

The man in the dark room was not a man at all, but a woman. She had been born with a condition that caused her body to grow hair on her face and chest, and so she wore the mask of a man, and the clothes of a man. She was in love with another woman who, apparently, was in love with another man. The two women were friends. They met regularly at the bar near the train station. The friend of the man-looking-woman never realized it was all a lie. They talked about men, how they were so handsome. One day they went for a walk in the park, as they often did. They talked about men again, how much they loved them. It was all appearances. They both knew but none of them dared to share this thought. That day in the park, the man-looking-woman said “I have to show you something", and took her mask off, revealing her true identity: she was not a man at all but a woman like herself. Her friend was in shock. However, she was able to handle the situation with courage. She opened up to her, and told her: "I have to tell you something. I didn't know you were a woman, I never realized. But... but I love you". Both of their hearts melted. They knew they could be together forever. And so did they.
===
 Every day for the past three years, the man has brought his lover to this very spot. He has brought her here, to the top of the hill, where they can look over the city and pay homage to the mountain that looms behind them. He tells her how he met God in a dream, how he created her in His image, how He told him that love was worth clinging to. Down below their home there is a city of people who have been touched by God’s grace: an old man who can balance a cup on his nose; a teenage girl who can bend metal with her bare hands; a baby boy whose tears are so hot they burn holes in his mother’s breast. The man has told his lover about each and every one of them, about each and every miracle. She listens without commenting anything. He keeps on talking about how wonderful that city is, but doesn't see herself living there, since she wasn't touched by God's grace. "Are you serious", the man asked. "Of course, they all have some sort of powerful spark that I... I just don't have", she replied. "That's only because you never saw yourself in a mirror, you're the most beautiful woman I ever met in my life", the man said, "that's how God touched you, my love". She hugged and kissed him, and whispered to his ear, "then bring me there, because we would be the perfect couple".
===
The man’s eyes were the color of a stormy sky and his hair was the color of a raven’s wing. He was tall and broad shouldered, like a tree, with arms that could fill her embrace for eternity. She fell in love with him at first sight, and she knew that he felt the same. They had so much in common: they both loved to read, they both loved to travel, they both loved to dance. They spent hours talking about their favorite books, their favorite places, their favorite music. They talked about all the places they wanted to go together: Paris, Venice, Rome… Their wedding day was a glorious affair. It was held in an ancient church with stained glass windows and high vaulted ceilings. The guests were dressed in their finest clothes and jewels glittered on every finger. There were flowers everywhere: roses for love; lilies for beauty; irises for royalty; tulips for devotion; daffodils for innocence; lilies of the valley for purity. It was but a dream wedding of an adolescent girl with her prince charming. 
===
In the morning, the girl and the boy were still in bed. The boy was snoring softly, his face buried in a pillow. The girl was staring at the ceiling, her eyes wide open. They had been up all night, talking. The girl had told him about her childhood, growing up in a small town with her father and mother. She told him about how she used to play with dolls and how she used to pretend they were real children that she could take care of and how she had started to imagine that real children needed taking care of. He seemed to listen, but he didn’t say much, just an occasional nod, and few cliché questions. The night had passed with the girl pouring her identity into the challis of this stranger who she held to be so dear. However it seemed as if fate had united the both of them but for different reasons and purposes.
===
  The boy looked at the girl and the girl looked at the boy. They were both looking for something, but neither knew what. They tried to talk about it, but they never got far before giving up. The boy tried to tell the girl he didn’t know what he was looking for, that if she wanted to leave him she should just go and not worry about him. He said this because he thought that if she left him then at least he could stop looking for something that wasn’t there. The girl said nothing in response, because she was too busy thinking about how she didn’t know what love was supposed to feel like, look like, taste like or sound like and whether it would be possible for her to learn how to love someone else when she couldn’t even figure out how to love herself. So they carried on living together, day after day, month after month, year after year, without ever saying a word about what they were both looking for, and in this conundrum of uncertainty lives passed.

She was in love with a woman who was in love with another man. They met regularly at the bar near the train station. Her friend talked about her man, how he was so handsome and so caring towards her. One day they went for a walk in the park together, as they often did. She talked about her man again, how much she loved him. how she could never choose between them. And then finally said out of curiosity “I wish you weren’t wearing that mask” and took it off her friend’s face to reveal her true identity: she was not a man at all but a woman like herself.  Perhaps vying to understand how to be loved as normal people are. How to distinguish between love and infatuation.

  In the old days, he had been a great warrior. He could run for hours without tiring, and he could hurl spears with such accuracy that even the most powerful of enemies would fall before him. But then he fell in love with the wrong woman. She had hair like a beauteous waterfall and skin as smooth as silk. He was so taken by her beauty that he forgot about his duties, and soon his people were starving. They turned against him, eventually driving him out of town. As an outcast, he wandered aimlessly until he came upon a peach tree in full bloom. He sat under it for days, watching the petals fall and feeling his heart grow heavier by the second as his eyes glazed over with tears. The peach tree was so moved by the warrior’s devotion that it called to its sister trees to help it make one last gift for the man: a bowl made entirely out of glass that would never stain or shatter because it was made from his tears.

They were architects, but they spent their lives building the smallest things: trinkets that fit in a palm of a hand, roses that could rest in someone’s hair. But when they were married, they began to build bigger things – castles with faithful sentinels for servants and turrets with carved columns, waterfalls flowing with emeralds and replicas of themselves; redoubts where their enemies would sleep forever; towers big enough for all the winds of time to sweep through. They built these structures deep in the woods where no one else would see them, and their hands slowly became hard from pushing against the canvass before them. At night, they slept on separate sides of the room; he on a bed whose frame was made from two pieces of oak that had been sawn into shape by his own hands; she floating on a raft made out of glass plates inlaid over an invisible flotation device. Once every month or two months or three months he would lay her down on this raft-bed and kiss her as she floated across the night sky towards their secret mountainside castle.

  The boy feels like a prisoner in his own body. His skin is too tight, his bones are too tall, his joints are too stiff. The man who holds him captive is a stranger, and yet he is the only one who knows him. He knows how to make him smile, how to make him laugh. He knows how to make him feel good about himself. He loves him as only a father can love a son, and yet the boy cannot remember what it was like to have this man's blood running through his veins. He remembers nothing but the feel of this man's hand on his face, on his hair, on his shoulder. The boy does not know whether he loves or hates this man who has raised him from infancy with such tenderness and ferocity. Sometimes he feels like he should hate him, but then the man will smile or laugh and the boy forgets why he was angry in the first place.  A life of confused identity.

  When I met her she was a half-eaten orange, lying with her peels sprawled all around her like discarded metal petals. She wasn’t human then, but I didn’t care. Oranges are the best lovers anyway: so fragile and juicy, they have the sweetest skin and tender sides that you can pin to your lips. I knew she was not what she seemed: a sweet angel fallen from the Heavens, but it didn’t matter to me. It wasn't until after I'd eaten every part of her out of existence that she told me that if you don't die when you're bitten by a vampire, you become one yourself. I told her that vampires are impure creatures full of ill intentions; that they are not like the fair children of sun-drenched days too vivid and unreal to be true; but for all my scare talk there was nothing to say about the hunger inside me: my heart wanting nothing more than to be swept off its feet by a kind stranger with devious intentions.  Still I chose to sublimate.

The couple sat in the corner of a bar, where the music was loud and the drinks were cheap. He told her everything. He told her about how he had been living on the street for years, how people would avert their eyes as he held out his cup to them. He told her about how he had only boarded up the windows of his apartment after it was broken into, how no one even noticed him when they walked by. He told her about how he had stolen this coat from a shop, and that hat from a man who'd been passed out in an alleyway. She listened to all of this quietly, nursing her drink when she wasn't looking at him. When they walked outside, she took off his coat and handed it back to him. She took off his hat and handed it back to him as well. As she walked away from him down the street, she didn't look back once to see if he was following her or not. For love if true would return.
